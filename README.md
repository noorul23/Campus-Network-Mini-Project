# SDN-Inspired Secure Campus Network Design (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This repository contains a **mini-project focused on the design and simulation of a secure campus network topology for our university IT department**, inspired by **Software Defined Networking (SDN)** architectural concepts. The network was **designed and validated using Cisco Packet Tracer** as part of an academic mini-project.

> ⚠️ **Important Note:**  
> ⚠️ *This work focuses strictly on **network design and simulation** and does **not include real-world SDN controller implementation or programmable network devices**.*

## 📄 Abstract

This project presents a secure campus network topology for  our university IT department, designed and simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer, inspired by Software Defined Networking (SDN) architectural concepts. The network includes multiple IT labs, administrative offices, and a conference hall, all segmented using VLANs and interconnected through a **Router-on-a-Stick configuration with RIP as the dynamic routing protocol**. The design demonstrates **centralized monitoring concepts, secure subnet isolation**, and **verified inter-department communication using ICMP testing**. This work focuses only on **network design and simulation**, without real-world SDN controller implementation.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Design a **secure campus network** for our university IT department  
- Apply **SDN-inspired centralized architectural concepts**  
- Implement **VLAN-based segmentation**  
- Enable **inter-VLAN routing using RIP**  
- Simulate and **verify connectivity using Cisco Packet Tracer**

## 🏗️ SDN Architecture Overview

The network follows a **three-layer SDN-inspired model**:

- **Application Layer** – Network monitoring & logical control (conceptual)
- **Control Layer** – SDN Controller (conceptual)
- **Infrastructure Layer** – Routers, switches, PCs, printers
